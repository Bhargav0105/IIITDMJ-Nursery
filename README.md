# ABOUT OUR NURSERY :
IIITDMJ Nursery is a retail nursery that delivers plants and seeds to general public for home as well as for commercial garden purposes. We’ve assured a 24/7 support online chatbot for queries regarding plants, their care and delivery. We provide every details of each product about favourable climatic conditions for maximum yield as well as kind of soil and amount of watering required.
